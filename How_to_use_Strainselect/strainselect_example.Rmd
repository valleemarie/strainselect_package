# Examples of the application of the strainselect package

this vignette will show you some examples of how to use the strainselect package using a single dataset with a variety of specific cases.

the dataset contains the characteristics of 300 salmonella strains distributed over 24 variables .

```{r}
raw_data <- read.csv("data_ex_300.csv",sep=";")
raw_data
```

For these examples, we want to focus the selection on 6 variables : CONTEXTE, MATRICE1, REGION, SECTEUR, LIEUPVT and ANNEE. The first thing we do is use the prepare_input function to keep only the metadata on which you want to base your selection.

```{r}
prepared_data <- strainselect::prepare_input(raw_data,col_select=c(7,10,13,14,17,24),id=1, date=17, m=F, a=T)
prepared_data
```

If you have a duplicate Strain ID in your data set, the following error message will be displayed and the data preparation process will not be successful.

Depending on the number of strains you can sequence, two selection methods are possible.

If you have no restrictions on the number of strains to be sequenced, you should use the interaction method. This method allows you to select all the different strain profiles.

The prepare_upset function first converts the prepared_data data frame into a binary matrix and then you can visualize the interactions in an upset graph.

```{r}
upset_data <- strainselect::prepare_upset(prepared_data)
upset_data
UpSetR::upset(upset_data,nset = 70, order.by = "freq", mb.ratio = c(0.30,0.70),set_size.show = T, nintersects = NA)
```

This graph shows all groups containing identical strains and their characteristics.

The define_profile function is then used for the identification of these groups.

```{r}
upset_profiles <- strainselect::define_profiles(upset_data)
upset_profiles
```

Finally, the select_profiles function is used to randomly select one strain per group that will be sequenced.

```{r}
strain_select_profiles <- strainselect::select_profiles(upset_profiles, prepared_data)
strain_select_profiles
```
