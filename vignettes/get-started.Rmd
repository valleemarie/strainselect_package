<!-- WARNING - This vignette is generated by {fusen} from /dev/flat_full.Rmd: do not edit by hand -->

<!-- Run this 'development' chunk -->

<!-- Store every call to library() that you need to explore your functions -->

```{=html}
<!--
 You need to run the 'description' chunk in the '0-dev_history.Rmd' file before continuing your code there.

If it is the first time you use {fusen}, after 'description', you can directly run the last chunk of the present file with inflate() inside.

# Include some data examples in your package

```{=html}
<!-- 
 Store your dataset in a directory named "inst/" at the root of your project.
 Use it for your tests in this Rmd thanks to `pkgload::load_all()` to make it available
and `system.file()` to read it in your examples.

- There already is a dataset in the "inst/" directory to be used in the examples below
-->
```
# prepare_input function

```{=html}
<!--
Create a chunk for the core of the function

- The chunk needs to be named `function` at least
- It contains the code of a documented function
- The chunk can also be named `function-my_median` to make it easily
findable in your Rmd
- Let the `@examples` part empty, and use the next `examples` chunk instead to present reproducible examples

After inflating the template

-  This function code will automatically be added in a new file in the "R/" directory
-->
```
```{=html}
<!--
Create a chunk with an example of use for your function

- The chunk needs to be named `examples` at least
- It contains working examples of your function
- The chunk is better be named `examples-my_median` to be handled
correctly when inflated as a vignette

After inflating the template

-  This example will automatically be added in the '@examples' part of our function above in the "R/" directory
- This example will automatically be added in the vignette created from this Rmd template
-->
```
```{r examples-prepare_input}

# Example with your dataset in "inst/"
datafile <- system.file("data_test.csv", package = "strainselect")
raw_data <- read.csv(datafile, sep = ";",header = T)
# Apply my function
prepare_input(raw_data,col_select = c(7,10,13,14,17,24),
              id=1,date=17,m=FALSE,a=TRUE)
```

```{=html}
<!--
Create a chunk with a test of use for your function

- The chunk needs to be named `tests` at least
- It contains working tests of your function
- The chunk is better be named `tests-my_median` to be handled
correctly when inflated as a vignette

After inflating the template

-  This test code will automatically be added in the "tests/testthat/" directory

# assess_gower function

```{=html}
<!--
There can be other functions, examples and tests in your flat template.
Each of them will be inflated in a different file, provided that there is a level-1 or level-2 section title to separate from previous functions.

# There can be development actions

Create a chunk with 'development' actions

- The chunk needs to be named `development` or `dev`
- It contains functions that are used for package development only
- Note that you may want to store most of these functions in the 0-dev_history.Rmd file

These are only included in the present flat template file, their content will not be part of the package anywhere else.
-->
```
# Inflate your package

You're one inflate from paper to box. Build your package from this very Rmd using `fusen::inflate()`

-   Verify your `"DESCRIPTION"` file has been updated
-   Verify your function is in `"R/"` directory
-   Verify your test is in `"tests/testthat/"` directory
-   Verify this Rmd appears in `"vignettes/"` directory
